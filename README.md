## Installation

You can install Getta with the command below.

```shell
yarn add getta
```

The library depends on isomorphic-fetch, so this will also need to be installed in your project,
along with core-js, @babel/runtime and lodash.

```shell
yarn add isomorphic-fetch core-js @babel/runtime lodash --dev
```
